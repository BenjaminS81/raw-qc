# Raw-QC Pipeline

### A pipeline to control the quality and trim adapters of FastQ files.

Raw-QC is a standard quality control pipeline written in bash.
Input reads (paired or single) adapters are removed with Autotropos a wrapper of Atropos.
Autotropos is able to detect adapters contents from a list of adapters.
